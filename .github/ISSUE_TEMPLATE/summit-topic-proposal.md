**Pre-requisite knowledge**

<!--
List pre-requisite knowledge that it would be required for participants to have. This is different from Level above. Pre-requisite knowledge

It's ok to keep this very short, especially if you haven't yet finalized the specifics.

Here's a handy [guide](https://github.com/nodejs/summit/blob/master/SESSION_FACILITATOR_GUIDE.md) for the person or persons who will facilitate this session.
