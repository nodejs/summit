# Example Dual CommonJS/ES Module Package

This package does the things a baby does, in emoji form.

This is an example of a dual package that follows the “ES module wrapper” approach described in https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_approach_1_use_an_es_module_wrapper.

This package has no state, so the wrapper isn’t really necessary for this trivial example package; to see the native ES module versions of this package’s functions run, edit the `"default"` line in this package’s `package.json` to be `"default": "./dist-es/index.js"`. That would be the recommended change for a theoretical future version of this package where CommonJS support was dropped.

To build the ES module version, run `npm run build-module`. To build the CommonJS version, run `npm run build-commonjs`. See `package.json`.
