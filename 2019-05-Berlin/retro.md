## Keep doing it :+1:

> This list includes what we should continue to do:

* Having a foundation-wide collab summit
* The collab summit should continue its focus on `collaborative, working sessions` over talks
* Having event at a venue that also handles the food. That was a major burden off the organizers' shoulders.
* (part keep/part start) We should keep the operational values of the collab summit, and try to capture them in a 'guiding principles' document so newcomers and organizers can share expectations (see [#181](https://github.com/nodejs/summit/issues/181)).
* AMAs were very useful on giving people background information

## Stop doing it :hand:

> This list includes what we should no longer do:

* Using a Google form for submissions. It was a hassle and didn't really net us anything since the form failed for a few people and we ended up having to use GH and the form. 

* Waiting so long to finalize remote participation strategy - that was definitely a challenge for some who wanted to join or present remotely.

## Start doing it :white_check_mark:

> This list includes what we should try doing next time

* Using labels to signal `leveling` on sessions (see [#179](https://github.com/nodejs/summit/issues/179)) 
* Create a spreadsheet for the organizers to better track where we're at with the budget
* Creating more clarity around CoC escalation process (we accidentally sent mixed messages about the reporting process). 
* Look for venues that have the spaces we need more centralized - ideally the rooms are all closer together (we didn't end up using all the spaces we rented as a result)
* Open up the call for sessions for the next collab summit as soon as current one is over?
* folks wanted to continue the AMA with format similar to the summit
    - through a live zoom call with people that can answer questions
    - the foundation could put this on
    - questions submitted beforehand
    - answer questions after the fact too
        - do it regularly - need to talk to Tracy about logistics
    - do it every 3 months and socialize it a month beforehand
    - add a time when we lock the schedule so there are no changes
