## Session Facilitator Information
It would be fantastic if each one of the breakouts is facilitated by a person who will be responsible to "run" the breakout and do a quick presentation at the end. This person would also set outcomes from the breakout to  optimally leverage our time together. There is a facilitator guide available [here](https://github.com/nodejs/summit/blob/master/SESSION_FACILITATOR_GUIDE.md).
