# Collaborator Summit Berlin 2019 - May 30th and 31th ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

This is a live document that will be constantly updated to match the proposed agenda.

Our time will be best served with some monotrack presentations and discussions in the first day, and then breakout rooms in the second day. __We can change everything__, so if you think a better structure will suit us better, let us know in #135!

It would be fantastic if each one of the breakouts is facilitated by a person who will be responsible to "run" the breakout and do a quick presentation at the end. This person would also set outcomes from the breakout to  optimally leverage our time together.

âœ¨ We're excited for Node.js' 5th round of collaboration IRL! Even better, we're excited that folks from the JSF will be joining us for the first time! âœ¨

Include a link to an issue in this repo with more detail, similar to https://github.com/nodejs/summit/issues/86_ that contains at least an abstract, a link to the planning issue in the working group repo, and any extra requests (minimum space during conf, av/sound, etc.).


## Organizers

- name (@github-handle)


## Attendance

Anyone can come, but we will not be explicitly onboarding at Collab 
Summit Vancouver. Conversations can move fast as working groups have 
a lot of context. Unlike the Fall instance of the Collab Summit, this Spring instance does not include a morning of Code + Learn, the session that guides people through contributing to the project.

Working groups will put together a brief schedule so that people can 
familiarize themselves before folks get onsite, having the general collaborator 
discussions, and then dive into breakout sessions.

Attendees must register at: (TBA)

  
## Travel Fund
There are funds available for any Individual Member of the Node.js Foundation to receive travel funds to Collab Summit.  Membership is free for active collaborators. Sign up [HERE](https://github.com/nodejs/members#members).

PLEASE follow the instructions for application to receive travel funds [HERE](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/MEMBER_TRAVEL_FUND.md#process).

âœ¨ Super stoked to see everyone in May! âœ¨
