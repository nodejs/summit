# OpenJS Foundation Collaborator Summit

The OpenJS Foundation hosts regular summits for active contributors to the foundation projects, this repository is being used to organize them.

## Upcoming Events
- June 25 – 26, 2020 - Austin, Texas, USA

__Note:__ per the current [Novel Coronavirus Update](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/openjs-world/attend/novel-coronavirus-update/) the OpenJS World is still planned to take place, as is the OpenJS Collab Summit. Please check regularly for updates on this as it might change due to current circumstances.

We also ask everyone who is considering applying for the [Travel Fund](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/master/project-resources/MEMBER_TRAVEL_FUND.md) to hold off any flight ticket purchases and accommodation arrangements until further notice.

## Planning Meetings

Every 2 weeks on Tuesday - see [issues](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/summit/issues) for meeting notices and agendas

6:00 – 7:00pm UTC 

Join via Zoom: https://zoom.us/j/742726725 - Everyone is welcome!

## Cost
Free!

Although the summits may be coordinated with other events/conferences, you do not need to pay/attend those events to participate in a summit. We also have travel funds for individual members of the Node.js foundation (e.g. Node.js core collaborators) to cover their travel expenses. See [the documentation on travel funds](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/tree/master/proposals/stage-2/TRAVEL_FUND#openjs-travel-fund) for details.
