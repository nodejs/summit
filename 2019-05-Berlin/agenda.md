# Collaborator Summit Berlin 2019 - May 30th and 31th ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

This is a live document that will be constantly updated to match the proposed agenda.

A collaborator summit is a mix of presentations and interactive sessions lead by the Teams, Working Groups, and Projects that participate in the summit. For interactive sessions, our time is best served if a the team/working groups/project participate in good numbers (quorum etc).

__We can change everything__, so if you think a better structure will suit us better, let us know in #135, or just send a PR!

It would be fantastic if each one of the breakouts is facilitated by a person who will be responsible to "run" the breakout and do a quick presentation at the end. This person would also set outcomes from the breakout to  optimally leverage our time together. There is a facilitator guide available [here](https://github.com/nodejs/summit/blob/master/SESSION_FACILITATOR_GUIDE.md).

âœ¨ We're excited for Node.js' 5th round of collaboration IRL! Even better, we're excited that folks from the JSF will be joining us for the first time! âœ¨

## Attendance

Anyone can come, but we will not be explicitly onboarding at Collab 
Summit Berlin. Conversations can move fast as working groups have 
a lot of context. Unlike the Fall instance of the Collab Summit, this Spring instance does not include a morning of Code + Learn, the session that guides people through contributing to the project.

Working groups will put together a brief schedule so that people can 
familiarize themselves before folks get onsite, having the general collaborator 
discussions, and then dive into breakout sessions.

Attendees must register at: (TBA)

  
## Travel Fund
