## 🛬 Post-session checklist

- [ ] If applicable, chair/facilitator syncs up with participants and note-takers.
- [ ] Action items are posted as a comment in /summit issues and linked to in the relevant repos.
- [ ] Relevant teams and working groups are pinged using Github mentions. Note that teams not originally involved in the session may now need to be looped in if it became relevant during the session.
- [ ] (optional) If your sessions were not automatically published to youtube, please do that
