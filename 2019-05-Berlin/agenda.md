# Collaborator Summit Berlin 2019 - May 30th and 31th üá©üá™

This is a live document that will be constantly updated to match the proposed agenda.

A collaborator summit is a mix of presentations and interactive sessions lead by the Teams, Working Groups, and Projects that participate in the summit. For interactive sessions, our time is best served if a the team/working groups/project participate in good numbers (quorum etc).

__We can change everything__, so if you think a better structure will suit us better, let us know in #135, or just send a PR!

It would be fantastic if each one of the breakouts is facilitated by a person who will be responsible to "run" the breakout and do a quick presentation at the end. This person would also set outcomes from the breakout to  optimally leverage our time together. There is a facilitator guide available [here](https://github.com/nodejs/summit/blob/master/SESSION_FACILITATOR_GUIDE.md).

‚ú® We're excited for Node.js' 5th round of collaboration IRL! Even better, we're excited that folks from the JSF will be joining us for the first time! ‚ú®

## Organizers

- Matteo Collina ([@mcollina](https://github.com/mcollina))
- Manil Chowdhury ([@keywordnew](https://github.com/keywordnew))
- Tracy Lee ([@ladyleet](https://github.com/ladyleet))
- Waleed ([@WaleedAshraf](https://github.com/WaleedAshraf))
- Joyee ([@joyeecheung](https://github.com/joyeecheung))
- Jory ([@jorydotcom](https://github.com/jorydotcom))

## Attendance

Anyone can come, but we will not be explicitly onboarding at Collab
Summit Berlin. Conversations can move fast as working groups have
a lot of context. Unlike the Fall instance of the Collab Summit, this Spring instance does not include a morning of Code + Learn, the session that guides people through contributing to the project.

Working groups will put together a brief schedule so that people can
familiarize themselves before folks get onsite, having the general collaborator
discussions, and then dive into breakout sessions.

Attendees must register at [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/openjs-collaborator-summit-tickets-55985971548) with the password "collabsummit"

## Travel Fund
There are funds available for any Individual Member of the Node.js Foundation to receive travel funds to Collab Summit.  Membership is free for active collaborators. Sign up [HERE](https://github.com/nodejs/members#members).

PLEASE follow the instructions for application to receive travel funds [HERE](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/MEMBER_TRAVEL_FUND.md#process).
