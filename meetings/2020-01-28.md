    5. Other options are ~10 miles out from downtown Austin
        6. If cost-effective, pre-arranged shuttle options should be considered for further locations, so collaborators donâ€™t have to arrange their own rides.

    8. Registration with OpenJS Conference registration
        7. +1, need to have it ready to go at the same time
        8. Tickets go on sale within the next 3 weeks
        9. What other data do we want to collect at registration
            1. Project affiliation
            2. We need to have some kind of expectation-setting information 
            3. Celia to send a template 
            4. Registration for the summit-only - need to confirm how this will work (this will be available)
                1. Small charge - $10? Token fee to encourage commitment
                2. Keep summit registration open until last minute
    9. Ticket 
    10. charges for non-attendance
        10. This is hard for us to do in practice
        11. Cancellation penalties seem bad faith
4. **Summit Programming**
    11. Research Question: Would your project be interested in holding its own collab summit on the same day in the same city as the OpenJSF Collab Summit?
